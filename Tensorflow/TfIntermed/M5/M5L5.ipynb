    "### TensorFlow Lite also allows incorporating custom operators into the model, enabling the use of specialized operations or functions that are not natively supported by TensorFlow Lite. This is particularly useful when working with domain-specific models or utilizing hardware-specific features. To convert a model with custom operators, you need to implement the custom operators using TensorFlow Lite's C++ or Java APIs and then integrate them into the model conversion process. This involves modifying the model converter code to handle the custom operators correctly."
