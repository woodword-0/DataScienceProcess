    "## Model Optimization\n",
    "After the conversion, you can further optimize the TensorFlow Lite model to reduce its size and improve its performance. Techniques like quantization, which reduces the precision of the model's weights and activations, are commonly used for this purpose. Optimization is crucial to ensure efficient inference on devices with limited resources."

    "## Inference on Device\n",
    "With the TensorFlow Lite model deployed, you can perform inference directly on the device. This means the device can make predictions without relying on a server or internet connection. This is particularly useful for real-time applications or scenarios where data privacy is important."
