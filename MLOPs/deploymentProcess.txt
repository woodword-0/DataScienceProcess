1. Create an Azure DevOps account and set up a new project.

2. Connect your Github repository to your Azure DevOps project.

3. Create a Dockerfile that defines your ML model environment.

4. Build a Docker image using your Dockerfile and push it to Docker Hub or any other Docker registry.

5. Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace and deploy your Docker image to it.

6. Use Azure Pipelines to automate the deployment process. You can create a pipeline that triggers a build whenever there is a new commit to your Github repository.

7. Set up monitoring and logging for your ML model using Azure Application Insights.

8. Test your deployment and monitor it for any issues.



# Setting up the shell file:
1. Set variables: The first few lines of the script define several variables that will be used throughout the deployment process.
 These include the infrastructure version (bicep or terraform), project type (classical, cv, or nlp), 
 MLOps version (aml-cli-v2, python-sdk-v1, python-sdk-v2, or rai-aml-cli-v2), orchestration (azure-devops or github-actions), and several folder and project names.

2. Change directory: This line changes the working directory to the root folder location specified in the git_folder_location variable.

3. Clone project repo: This line clones the project template Git repository specified in the project_template_github_url variable to the $project_name folder in the working directory.

4. Sparse checkout: This line sets up a sparse checkout for the Git repository, so that only the necessary folders are downloaded.

4. Move files: These lines move the files from the subfolders created by the project template to the appropriate level in the project folder.

5. Move config file (if necessary): If the MLOps version is python-sdk-v1, the config-aml.yml file is moved to the root level of the project folder.

6. Clean up: These lines remove unnecessary subfolders from the project folder.

7. Upload to Github: These lines initialize a new Git repository, create a new private repository on Github with the specified project name and organization name, and push the files from the local Git repository to the remote repository.
